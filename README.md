 Unit 2 TreeHouse Project, Mobile First Responsive Layout

 This is a project for TreeHouse. 
 This responsive website adjusts for different screen 
 sizes, such as for mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers. 

 Specifically, there is a mobile-first approach for screens around 320px wide.
 At the 768px width, the layout adjusts to fit most tablet devices.
 Similarily, at 1024px wide, the layout adjusts to fit most desktop computers. 

 The layout starts as a single column and extends to a 3 column layout for main content as the screen widens. Top and bottom navigation styles also change with some 
 other minor stylistic changes. 

 This project utilizes HTML and CSS with an emphasis on Flexboxes using a mobile-first approach.
